Where possible, I've tried put books in order of recommendation or influence. Books at the top of these lists I'd consider a good next place to go on a learning journey while further down are on the radar.

To hunt for more sources, please see [[Book Sources]].

The goal is to make it easy to find what to read next, and reference or find material that I've read in the past.

When adding to these lists, please follow MLA style citation.
