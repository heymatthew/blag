<a class=summary href=/posts/airport-wifi/><p>While I was in Airport, I had a time limit on my Wifi which I used up too fast. So now all I&rsquo;ve got on my mind is the challenge of getting back onto the internet.
Who limits Wifi anyway? What are we? Savages?
In this case I didn&rsquo;t have to do much because I had a snippet of code I took from my old workmate Steve Purcell. It&rsquo;s sole purpose is to generate a random Mac address, and make that callable from the zsh shell.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/posts/crypto-directories/>Encrypted Directories</a></h3><time datetime=2017-06-03>Jun 3, 2017</time>
<a class=summary href=/posts/crypto-directories/><p>In the *nix ecosystem, there are a lot of tools that are great to chain together. I&rsquo;d encourage everyone to learn their tools, but sometimes the tools are complex, and you only want to do something simple.
I keep forgetting how to crypto. What I generally want to do is encrypt and sign a directory, then pull that same directory later.
Here&rsquo;s the script I threw together today. It takes one argument, either a directory to encrypt, or a gnupg encrypted tar gzipped directory and extracts it.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/posts/peer-to-peer-git/>Peer to Peer Git</a></h3><time datetime=2017-03-31>Mar 31, 2017</time>
<a class=summary href=/posts/peer-to-peer-git/><p>Sometimes your central git repository goes down, but you need to share code. That&rsquo;s a bummer, you can commit and wait, but you&rsquo;ve likely heard that you shouldn&rsquo;t need to rely on a central repo.
So you&rsquo;ve got a few options here:
Mirror your repo someplace else and switch upstreams during outages, email your stuff as patches using [git am][2], [2]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am setup a small read only local git server and pull between neighbours, or use some kind of highly available decentralised storage as an upstream like [ipfs git][4].</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/posts/ctags-ruby/>CTags in Ruby: Make code feel like a wiki</a></h3><time datetime=2017-02-21>Feb 21, 2017</time>
<a class=summary href=/posts/ctags-ruby/><p>In a browser you markup for links. A wiki builds on this behavior to describes topics, linking nouns to pages in context that link to other nown pages.
Browsing a wiki allows you to dive into information and build up your mental model of a subject area&ndash; which is kind of addictive. So why can&rsquo;t we do the same thing in our code?
Code has syntax which are just links between files.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/posts/handles-in-2016/>Handles in 2016</a></h3><time datetime=2016-09-23>Sep 23, 2016</time>

<a class=summary href=/posts/handles-in-2016/><p>For years I used the name &ldquo;Daemons Advocate&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know why, but at some stage I stopped liking it. This got tricky, anytime I get to know a name I start to dislike it.
Picking a handle is too hard. And everything I came up with is taken by some other schmo on the internets because if you&rsquo;re looking for a good short name in 2016, you&rsquo;re way late to the party.</p></a></p></div><footer><p><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png></a></p><p>This work is licensed under a
