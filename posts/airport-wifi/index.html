too fast. So now all I&rsquo;ve got on my mind is the challenge of getting
back onto the internet.</p><p>Who limits Wifi anyway? What are we? Savages?</p><p>In this case I didn&rsquo;t have to do much because I had a snippet of code I
took from my old workmate <a href=https://www.sanityinc.com/about>Steve Purcell</a>. It&rsquo;s sole purpose is to
generate a random Mac address, and make that callable from the zsh
shell.</p><p>Because he never got around to publishing it, here it goes!</p><pre tabindex=0><code>function randommac() {
  ruby -e &#39;puts (&#34;%02x&#34;%((rand 64)*4|2))+(0..4).inject(&#34;&#34;){|s,x|s+&#34;:%02x&#34;%(rand 256)}&#39;
}
</code></pre><p>If you put this in your zshrc, it&rsquo;ll happliy generate you a mac address.
Here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d call it:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>randommac
&gt; e2:f0:48:69:cc:7c
</code></pre><p>The only way the router can identify you is through your hardware
address. Use this command to set your wifi&rsquo;s mac and that should get you
around being identified. In my case, I reset my hardware address by
running:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>sudo ifconfig en0 lladdr $(randommac)
</code></pre><p>Reconnecting got me another hit of that sweet sweet wifi! Thanks Steve!</p></main></div></body></html>
